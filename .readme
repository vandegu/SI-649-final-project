Files and descriptions from the data repository:

steam.csv:
  Main file. Contains lots of information, organized by video game title.
  "appid" field is the primary key between this and other data.

steam_description.csv:
  Contains the textual descriptions of the games in various formats (long, short, etc).
  Could be useful to do some simple text mining.

steamspy_tag_data.csv:
  Contains the number of tags that users have applied to each video game title. Useful for
  categorization by user-input.

Other steam files are less likely to be useful.
